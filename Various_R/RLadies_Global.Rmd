This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Canada & USA 
PhD = 228
Masters = 198
Bachelors = 44
Null = 67 

```{r}
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly(
  x = c("PhD", "Masters", "Bachelors","Null"),
  y = c(228, 198, 44, 67),
  name = "RLadies Degrees",
  type = "bar",
  color = "pink"
)

#fig <- fig %>% add_trace( xaxis = 'RLadies Degrees')
fig <- fig %>% layout(yaxis = list(title = 'Count'))

fig

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
